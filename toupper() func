                       //then return 65 (95-32) in integer
                       //(-32 comes from different of 'a'(97 in ASCII) and 'A'(65 in ASCII) which is 32)
    //since we want it to be a character so we declare a character variable
    //in this case 'ch', to take an ASCII value an turn it to character. 
    
    //so that is how 'a' turns to 'A'
    cout << ch; //output : A

    //same concepts occupied with tolower() func just upside down.
